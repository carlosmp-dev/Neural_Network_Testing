Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository hosts a collection of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models aimed at accurately recognizing handwritten digits. Each .py file implements a different CNN architecture, allowing for experimentation with various network depths, kernel sizes, regularization techniques, and data augmentation strategies. By comparing the performance of these models, the project seeks to identify the most effective design choices and hyperparameters for this classic image classification problem.

Project Overview

Digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, often serving as a benchmark for evaluating model architectures and training methodologies. While MNIST is the traditional dataset of choice, the underlying principles extend to more complex domains and larger-scale datasets. In this project, multiple CNNs are trained and evaluated on the same digit recognition dataset, enabling a head-to-head comparison of their accuracy, parameter counts, training times, and other key performance metrics.
